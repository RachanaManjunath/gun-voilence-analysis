## gun-voilence-analysis

FiveThirtyEight, a data journalism site devoted to politics, sports, science, economics, and culture, recently published a series of articles on gun deaths in America. Gun violence in the United States is a signicant political issue, and while reducing gun deaths is a noble goal, we must  understand the causes and patterns in gun violence in order to craft appropriate policies. As part of the project, FiveThirtyEight collected data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, as well as other governmental agencies and non-profits, on all gun deaths in the United States from 2012-2014.

Steps and questions answered: 

1. Generate a data frame that summarizes the number of gun deaths per month.
2. Generate a bar chart with labels on the x-axis. That is, each month should be labeled \Jan",\Feb", \Mar" and etc.
3. Generate a bar chart that identifies the number of gun deaths associated with each type of intentcause of death. The bars should be sorted from highest to lowest values.
4. Generate a boxplot visualizing the age of gun death victims, by sex. Print the average age of
female gun death victims.
5. How many white males with at least a high school education were killed by guns in 2012?
6. Which season of the year has the most gun deaths? Assume that
{ Winter = January - March
{ Spring = April - June
{ Summer = July - September
{ Fall = October - December
7. Are whites who are killed by guns more likely to die because of suicide or homicide? How does
this compare to blacks and Hispanics?
8. Are police-involved gun deaths significantly diffierent from other gun deaths? Assess the rela-
tionship between police involvement and other variables.
